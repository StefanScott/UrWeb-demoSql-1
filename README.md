This is a very minor modification of the simple UrWeb Sql demo here:

http://www.impredicative.com/ur/demo/

Question:

The function `delete` takes two arguments: an `int` and `()` - in the original demo, and in this modified demo.

If the second argument is removed, the program no longer compiles.

Why is this second argument necessary?

Thanks for any help!
